# Power Dataset Generation
<p align="justify">
  These are the simulation codes for generating the power datasets used for training the surrogate models.

# How to run?

The code is self-explanatory. Modify and run `surrogate_model_dataset_gen.m`.

Note: The training datasets for the 256-antenna system are relatively large. You can either generate them using the codes here or download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fVUAPgspueg81pSamlwUoCm1Vv2yaiek/view?usp=sharing).
